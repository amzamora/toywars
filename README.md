# Toywars

A simple tactics game.

## Dependencies

Toywars compiles and uses raylib, so raylib dependecies must be installed to be able to build toywars. If you are on Ubuntu this can be achieved with:
```
sudo apt install libasound2-dev mesa-common-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

If you are on an on another distro I recommend you to look to the [raylib documentation](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux).

## Build

On a linux machine, run:

```
make
```

## To run

```
./toywars
```
